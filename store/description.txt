Always Early — Never be late to a meeting again.

Always Early automatically opens browser tabs for your upcoming Google Calendar meetings a few minutes before they start. No more scrambling to find the meeting link — it's already open and waiting.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Connect your Google Calendar with one click.
2. Set how many minutes early you'd like tabs opened (default: 2 minutes).
3. That's it! Always Early runs quietly in the background.

When a meeting with a video conferencing link (Google Meet, Zoom, Teams, etc.) is about to start, Always Early automatically opens the tab for you.
